I love this song. It's like it was made specifically for me.

It features the clarinet, which I played as a kid. It does a good job showing of the range and timbre of the instrument, which is what really attracted me to it.

It has significant polyphony. I'm a huge sucker for that. It has this kind of swaying, braiding, one-over-the-other feel that resonates with me as a skater and skier.

The syncopation in the drums I love. Really groovy.

It very gradually swells adding in more and more layers. I love this in a song. Where it changes so gradually you don't really notice at the time. But at some point you look back and it's changed so much. What a metaphor for life!
