title: "Should Every Kid Learn to Code"

No.

I think a good way to start this conversation is to look at what we currently teach in schools and remember why we teach what we teach and we don't teach what we don't teach. We teach every

I have several worries about teaching kids to code. First of all I don't want to force anyone to do something they don't want to do. Kids are naturally curious and killing that curiosity is one of the worst things we could do. <Insert Ken Robinson TED Talk>

The school system has a tendency to create and exacerbate academic differences between students. An experiment was run to teach Chinese to some under-performing U.S. students. The trick was that the task wasn't presented academically. The students weren't told they were going to learn a language. They were just shown the symbols to recognize. They weren't primed with all their preconceived ideas about how they aren't smart and they're bad at school and learning a language is hard. The experiment was a great success.

Teaching code to students propagates technical debt. There are a lot of challenges to learning programming that propagate from generation to generation.

- "=" as the assignment operator is confusing
- switch fall-through
- floating-point math
- CSS was originally designed for styling documents, not for arbitrary graphics and applications
- Assuming text is ASCII
- 0-based arrays and mixing 0-based counting with 1-based counting
- mutability is the obvious way of doing things

These ideas are a bit like hazing in fraternities. People claim that "I had to do it, so the next generation should have to too."

Some of these are being questioned: [https://quorumlanguage.com/](https://quorumlanguage.com/)

By teaching kids to code with a vocational aim, we teach them all these. We make another generation suffer and we make it more likely that even further generations suffer.

I cringe at the idea of a teacher whose primary training isn't in programming just picking it up and teaching it. When a student asks a question deeper than the prepared curriculum,

Partial programming knowledge doesn't provide partial benefit if you teach from the bottom up. It does if you teach from the top down.

I frequent r/AskTechnology and r/AskProgramming. I see people asking for help with very common problems. A common response is to say "That's just a CRUD app. Not that hard to make. Learn python and django." The right answer in my opinion is more like this. "You want an ERP/CRM/CMS. You have a common problem. You don't need and shouldn't create a custom solution."

If we programmers as an industry do our jobs, we'll keep creating better languages, frameworks, libraries and tools to keep up with the increased demand for our labor. We should also increase productivity at all levels, from highly professional programmers, casual programmers, to "power users" and spreadsheet jockeys.

We should keep in mind the bigger picture goal. Empower kids to use tools to solve problems. Computers are a tool and programming is one way of telling a computer what to do. Proprietary software is disempowering, so we should avoid that. But
