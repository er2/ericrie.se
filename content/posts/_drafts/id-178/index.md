title: "Beginner OOP Exercise: Tell a story in code"
draft: true
---

Here's an idea I had for teaching OOP concepts to beginners. Tell a story in code. That is write some code in a very fluent style and don't worry about it having to do anything. This frees the learner from having to grapple with making code that works. They can just focus on clarity and OOP concepts.

Actors in the story -> Objects

Actions -> methods

Subjects -> parameters

All the implementations at the leaf level just contain print statements.

This teaches a top-down style of programming. First the learner uses objects, then they make them compile
