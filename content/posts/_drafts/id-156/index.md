title: "UBI against Evil"

A Universal Basic Income would be an incredibly effective measure in reducing the amount of evil in the world. A terrible amount of evil is perpetrated by people who fear to lose their jobs.

I speculate that at least many millions of dollars are defrauded from Medicare by giving nursing home residents unnecessary physical therapy. If this hasn't already been studied, it should. You could start by looking at how recently people are given physical therapy before they die. A patient who is rapidly declining gains no benefit from physical therapy.

Netflix's show [Dirty Money](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81005045) covered the Wells Fargo fake account scandal. Most of the fake accounts were created by low level employees who were not well paid and didn't have many other career options.

Vice covered [sexual harassment in the restaurant industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob-bHRwqPsY). It sounds like a simple solution to quit your job if you're being sexually harassed. But the bills need to be paid. Harassers excuse their behavior with the fact that their victims don't quit. Then it creates a norm. And harassment just inches forward, from a casual comment, to something more explicit, to a inappropriate touching and beyond. If the victims had the security of UBI to fall back on, they wouldn't even have to threaten to quit. You could debate the sincerity of the harasser, but he expresses remorse. If he is sincere, that's a sign to me that a lot of this could have been prevented if it was acted on earlier. When accused of an easily prosecutable crime, the perpetrator is likely to deny and try to cover his ass. If that's not on the table, he can just apologize and make amends.
