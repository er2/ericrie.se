![cockroachdb](images/cockroachdb.png)I know nothing about design but this is a great logo. The two circular arcs that make up the body and antennae create a partial Venn diagram, referencing the set theory and relational algebra that form the theoretical foundation for this and any relational database. The shape on the back of the cockroach evokes a funnel, the universal symbol for filtering: a fundamental database operation.
