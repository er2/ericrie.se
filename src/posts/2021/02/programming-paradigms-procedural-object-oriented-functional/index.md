## Problem

You're at dinner with a group of friends. Everyone knows how much their meal cost. You have to add up each person's meal cost to get a total.

- You: $11
- Alice: $10
- Bob: $12
- Claire: $13

## Procedural

You call out to each person and ask them how much their meal cost. As they answer, you write on a piece of paper.

> 11 + 10 = 21
> 
> 21 + 12 = 33
> 
> 33 + 13 = 46

## Object-Oriented

You have a calculator. You announce to everyone to key in their meal cost. You key in 11. You give the calculator to Alice. When Claire hands it to you it reads 46.

## Functional

> You: Alice, what was the total for you and everyone to your left?
> 
> Alice: Bob, what was the total for you and everyone to your left?
> 
> Bob: Claire, what was the total for you and everyone to your left?
> 
> Claire: What was the total for you and everyone to your left?
> 
> You: $11 Claire
> 
> Clair: $24 Bob
> 
> Bob: $36 Alice
> 
> Alice: $46
