title: "Solving Phone Spam"

The root problem of phone spam is "Do I know this caller is who they say they are?" Technically speaking, this is a solved problem. It's the same problem you face when visiting your bank's website. We solve this with SSL and PKI.

When speaking with lay people about SSL, we usually talk about encrypting traffic to and from the server so that eaves can't be dropped. I'm not sure most people know about the other necessary part of security, which is that you need to know you're talking to the right person and not a hacker. Encryption only ensures that you're being hacked by no more than one person.

An additional benefit of this is that this provides security when I call my bank. They have more confidence that it's me. I just had an incident where I called my bank and the call dropped twice and then they kicked me out.
