title: "Pareto: ideas for solving the COBOL problem"
draft: true
---

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm talking about.

A perennial problem in programming is that of COBOL in the modern world.

First, a problem statement. I don't think COBOL itself is the problem. The problems are tech debt and mismanagement, as has been discussed previously. But also, what I haven't seen discussed precisely is the fact that the COBOL ecosystem has diverged from the rest of the programming world, and has regressed.

New implementation of COBOL with a JVM style architecture and a new language that compiles to the same IR/bytecode

New language is a pareto improvement over COBOL: has it's best features, is trivially interoperable at a low level, has all the most important features of modern industrial languages (Swift, Kotlin, C#, etc)

Modern tooling, especially an IDE or language server

Modern testing framework

Identify patterns like global variables with tracing derived data.

Tidelift - style subscription to tooling on an all-you-can-eat basis, so the likes of IBM, JetBrains and COBOL cowboys can fund COBOL ecosystem tooling development
