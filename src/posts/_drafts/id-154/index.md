title: "An Algorithmic Solution to Education"

The market for education isn't as dynamic and responsive as I would expect. Many students want a straight path to good paying job. Traditional non-profit institutions are more oriented to towards producing the next generation of academics and preserving their prestige. For-profit institutions seem on the surface to cater to students by offering online courses oriented towards marketable skills, with accommodating schedules. But in practice, they leave a lot to be desired when you investigate the quality of the education they provide.

I propose an algorithmic solution to this problem. That algorithm is none other than Page Rank, the algorithm that put Google on the map. Funnily, Page Rank is named after its creator, Larry Page, not after the web pages that it ranks.

Page Rank works by analyzing the directed graph of links between web pages. A page that has many incoming links is judged to be higher quality, and therefore ranks higher in search results. Furthermore, links from a highly ranked page carry more weight, increasing the rank of the linked-to page more than links from lower ranked pages.

What does this have to do with schools? How do schools link to one another? The answer is transfer credits. Academic institutions rate one another when deciding whose credits to accept. The beauty of this system is it's potentially not game-able. Schools have incentives in both directions: not to be overly stingy in accepting transfers, nor too accepting. A school doesn't want to accept transfer credits from another school it judges to be inferior, because that dilutes the value of its own degree. But it also doesn't want to deny transfer credits, because then the student will choose a competing institution.

So my proposal is simply that all academic institutions report the credits they accept and deny to the Department of Education. The Department of Education can then make this data publicly available for anyone to analyze and present.

The result would be a ranking without the arbitrariness of rankings like the US News and Reports ranking. That ranking is so powerful, that gaming it truly pays off. After juicing their numbers in the short term, schools find that they can attract better students and faculty and turn that into true improvements.

The US News ranking is arbitrary because it's an aggregate of multiple factors. Transfer credit acceptance is different because it just boils down to one thing: "Does this institution do a good enough job that we're willing to stick our name on a student that only split time between us and them."
