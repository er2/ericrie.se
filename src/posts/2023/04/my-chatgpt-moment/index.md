I was struck by inspiration while browsing [r/cocktails](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/)

So naturally I wanted to save this conversation to share. Screenshots, saving to HTML or printing all didn't work. So I had the idea to search stack overflow for some javascript that could dump out the current state of the DOM. I [found it](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72422258/3293405) and pasted it into my browser console. I got an error, so I figured let ChatGPT figure this out.
